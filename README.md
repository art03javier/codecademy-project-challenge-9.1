Project Goals
In this project, I used flexbox to design and build the layout for a company’s homepage. I choose to build a new homepage for an imaginary company!​
This project include:
1. A title and logo or splash image.
2. A mission statement or brief description of the company.
3. A list or set of images and titles representing the product or products of the company.
4. A section describing some of the company’s employees or teammates.
